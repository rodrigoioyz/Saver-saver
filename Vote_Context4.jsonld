    "comment": "While I support the idea of reducing the Net Change Limit to 250M ADA, I believe there are still key elements missing for us to have a fully informed discussion on this matter.\n\nAt this stage, we lack a clearly defined roadmap for budgeting, spending priorities, and long-term treasury strategy. Without this context, setting a strict limit could be premature or disconnected from the actual needs and goals of the ecosystem.\n\nThat said, I appreciate this governance action as a temperature check â€” an important step to raise awareness and spark community reflection. It highlights how much work we still need to do to build a solid foundation for treasury management.\n\nIn short, while I agree with the proposed adjustment to 250M ADA, I see this not as a final decision, but as an opportunity to initiate the broader conversation we still need to have."
