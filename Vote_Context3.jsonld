    "comment": "I fully support the roadmap because it addresses critical areas that will shape the future of Cardano.\n\nScaling layer 1 is essential to accessing new markets. If we can overcome the challenges of increasing speed without sacrificing security or decentralization, Cardano will be in a strong position to compete at a global level.\n\nEnabling DeFi for Bitcoin through Cardano is a brilliant idea. Bitcoin has massive liquidity, and allowing it to interact with decentralized finance on Cardano will open up entirely new opportunities for the ecosystem.\n\nMidgard is a must, and Hydra needs to continue progressing. High-throughput, low-fee solutions are crucial for the usability of Cardano, and both of these technologies are key to that goal.\n\nPeras is vital for transactions involving stablecoins and business adoption. In real-world business applications, transaction finality is a core security requirement. Faster confirmation times will make Cardano a much more attractive option for merchants and institutions.\n\nImproving the developer experience is critical. More developers mean more dApps, and maybe even the birth of a unicorn startup within the Cardano ecosystem. We need better tooling, APIs, and documentation to lower the barrier to entry and encourage innovation.\n\nWe need to focus on DeFi in Cardano, especially stablecoins, Soulbound Tokens, and DIDs (decentralized identities). These are foundational pieces for financial and identity applications that can bring real-world adoption.\n\nDiversifying node implementations is great, but it’s a massive task. There are excellent teams working on this, but it requires a lot of effort and coordination to ensure security and compatibility across implementations.\n\nRegarding incentive improvements, before voting on changes, I’d like to have clarity on the hardware specifications required to run Leios. We need to understand the real impact on stake pool operators before modifying incentive structures.\n\nA0 is important for the protocol, but it could become a trigger for centralization of computing power. Ensuring regional diversity is also a form of security, and we need to consider that when discussing protocol-level changes."
